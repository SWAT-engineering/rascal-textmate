# SYNTAX TEST "Rascal"

  "foo bar"
# ^^^^^^^^^ Constant

  "foo<x + 1>bar"
# ^^^^^     ^^^^^ Constant
#      ^^^^^      -Constant

### TODO: The following test shows that, currently, multi-line strings are
### disabled. This is because the converter determines that:
###   - `>` doesn't uniquely delineate interpolation (it could also be
###     greater-than in expressions or prioritize-before in grammars);
###   - `"` doesn't uniquely delineate strings (it could also be the end of
###     interpolation).
### Therefore, to avoid excessive tokenization errors, the converter doesn't
### generate begin/end patterns that begin with `>` or `"`. This might be
### improved in the future.

  "foo
# ^^^^ -Constant
  bar"
# ^^^^ -Constant
